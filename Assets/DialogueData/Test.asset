  dialogue:
  - Hello soldier! I am Lymph Node, and I'm here to guide you through the battle
    of your life (literally).
  - Immunity is a game that puts you in control of cells to teach you how your immune
    system works.
  - 'Your primary objective?

    To rid the bloodstream of viruses.'
  - Each playable cell has special abilities that contribute to the overall immune
    response.
  - Phagocytes (white) gobble up viruses that have not yet infected a host cell.
    Move toward viruses using WASD or the arrow keys.
  - "Helper T Cells\u2019 (purple) job is to stay near viruses that other antibodies
    have stuck to instruct other cells to finish the deed. Move using WASD or the
    arrow keys."
  - "B Cells (blue)  have two abilities: shoot antibodies by clicking in the direction
    you\u2019d like to aim and restrain infected cells until Killer Ts get there.
    Once again, move using WASD or the arrow keys."
  - Finally, Killer T Cells (green with spikes) inject instructions to kill infected
    tissue cells held by B cells. As before, move using WASD or the arrow keys.
  - If you hit Game Over, try playing in Vaccine Mode. It's easier because the vaccine
    does the grunt work before you start!
  - I hope you got all that. The whole body is counting on you. Best of luck!
