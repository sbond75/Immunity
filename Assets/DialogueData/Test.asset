  - Hello soldier! I am Lymph Node, and I'm here to guide through the battle of your
    life (literally).
  - Immunity is a game that puts you in control of cells to teach you how your immune
    system works.
  - 'Your primary objective?

    To rid the bloodstream of viruses.'
  - Each playable cell has special abilities that contribute to the overall immune
    response.
  - Phagocytes
  - Helper T Cells
  - Killer T Cells
  - B Cells
  - If you hit Game Over, try playing in Vaccine Mode. It's easier because the vaccine
    does the grunt work before you start!
  - I hope you got all that. The whole body is counting on you. Best of luck!
